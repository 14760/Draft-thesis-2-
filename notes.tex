\section{Readme from Sniekers}
\label{sec:notes readme from sniekers}

Uses NCBI 37.3 in MAGMA

     Association results of the meta-analysis for intelligence based on 78,308 individuals in 13 cohorts. 
     Version date: 10-07-2017

  Columns:
Chromosome: chromosome number
position: base pair position of the SNP on the chromosome (reported on GRCh37)
rsid: SNP rs number
ref: effect allele
alt: non-effect allele
N: sample size
MAF: minor allele frequency in UK Biobank
Beta: effect size of the effect allele
SE: standard error of the effect
Zscore: Z-score computed in METAL by a weighted Z-score method
p   value: P-value computed in METAL by a weighted Z-score method
direction: direction of the effect in each of the cohorts, order: CHIC (consisting of 6 cohorts), UKB-wb, UKB-ts, ERF, GENR, HU, MCTFR, STR

Beta/SE were calculated from METAL Z-scores using the formula from Zhu et al (Nature Genetics, 2016):

Beta = Zscore / sqrt( 2 * MAF * ( 1 - MAF) * ( N + $Zscore^2$ ) )
SE = 1 / sqrt( 2 * MAF * ( 1 - MAF ) * ( N + $Zscore^2$ ) )

\section{Community detection}

Communities allow the network to be broken up into smaller components which can be analysed in turn and which may represent functional units.


\section{Modularity}

for an adjacency matrix $A_{ij}$ we want to know how many edges pass between similar nodes that share a property be it an ontology term or a community membership.

Total number of edges is between nodes of same group is:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:notes_modularity_totaledges}
    \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j} A_{i,j}\delta_{g_i g_j}
\end{equation}

The expected number of edges between all nodes of the same type is 

\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j} \frac{k_i k_j}{2m}\delta_{g_i g_j}
\end{equation}

The modularity Q is 

\begin{equation}
    Q=\frac{1}{2m}\sum_{i,j}\textcolor{red}{(A_{i,j}-\frac{k_i k_j}{2m}}) \delta{g_i g_j}
\end{equation}

The red term is:

\begin{equation}
    B_{ij} = \sum_{i,j} A_{i,j} - \frac{k_i k_j}{2m}
\end{equation}

$\mathbf{B}$ is the modularity matrix which is n by n having elements $B_{i,j}$



\section{Centrality measures}
Betweeness, degree and closeness were described by Freeman, eigenvector centrality by Bonich \cite{valente2008correlated}

Boland degree closeness and flow centrality correlated but betweenness not

The correlation of symmetrised centrality measures are shown in table~\ref{tab:Correlation of centrality valente et al}. This study addressed 58 sociometric networks. The networks were directed and in order to calculated eigenvector centrality the networks were ``symmetrised" as described by the authors or made undirected. Degree had the strongest overall correlation 0.7 followed by eigenvector centrality 0.67.




\begin{table}[]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{lllll}
    \toprule
         & Degree & Eigenvector centrality & Closeness & Betweenness \\
         \midrule
    Degree  & 1  & 0.92  & 0.66 & 0.85\\
    Eigenvector centrality & 0.92 & 1 & 0.63 & 0.72  \\
    Closeness & 0.66 & 0.63 & 1 & 0.44  \\
    Betweenness& 0.85 & 0.72 & 0.44 & 1 \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Correlation of centrality measures for 58 sociometric network datasets from Valente et al \cite{valente2008correlated}. Pearson correlation coefficient. Values are for symmetrised closeness and betweenness centrality. Eigenvector centrality is necessarily symmetrised. Range of average network size 45-83. Some studies had maximal nominations for degree}
